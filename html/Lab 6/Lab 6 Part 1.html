<h1 class="header">Welcome to Lab 6 Page 1 (Part 1)</h1>
<p>This page is to have a prompt box that asks the visitor to enter a password to gain access<br />
to the page. It should continuously pop up and not allow access to the page until the correct<br />
password is entered.</p>

<p>I actually brought in an icon. I went to StackOverflow to see how to do this. I didn't know
that it would be covered in this class, so I went and looked it up outside of class.</p>

<p>Meep. This page is the first page of Lab 6. There is a button below that will send you to the 
second page of lab 6. Click it to go to the next page.</p>

<input type ="button" onclick = 'location.href = "Lab 6 Part 2.html"' value = "Part 2"/>

<blockquote id = "bq">This page should have a prompt box that prompts the user to enter a password.
It gives the user 3 attempts to enter the correct password. If the user does not enter the 
correct password in those 3 attempts, an alert box will display and when closed, it will send the user
to the san jac homesite.</blockquote>
<p>I created a generic css page that I really like. It's a pretty simple style sheet, but I 
actually like this one. I havent made a special setup for the blockquote, so it's pretty 
bland. Click the button below to give it a border.</p>

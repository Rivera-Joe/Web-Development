<h1 class = "header">Welcome to Page 3 of Lab 6</h1>

<script>
weekday();
</script>
<p>This page should have a prompt box that asks the user to enter a day of the week.
If the user enters anything other than a day of the week, such as a random word or a number
it will issue an alert message and allow the user to try again.</p>

<p>Actually, originally it was only supposed to allow the user to retry if they entered
a number. But I altered it to allow the user to re-do the prompt if they enter anything
other than a weekday (for example, the word: shark).</p>
<p>The button below uses the "go" method from the history object. I would only click it if
you came from the previous page. If you click it and you loaded this page directly, it will not work.</p>


<input type = "button" value = "Previous Page - H" onclick = "history.go(-1)"/>

<p>The button below will take you directly to page 2.</p>
<input type = "button" value = "Previous Page - L" onclick = "location.href = 'Lab 6 Part 2.html'"/>

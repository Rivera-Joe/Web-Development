<h1 class = "head">Welcome to the FireFox Page</h1>
<div class = "block">
<p>This is the firefox page. I chose orange and blue because those are the colors of the firefox emblem.</p>
<p>I went through about 8 different properties to check. I tried to make sure that some
of the properties were specific to the browser. I think it works pretty well.</p>
<p> I actually used to use Firefox but I found that Google Chrome worked better on my PC. I think firefox 
is the second best browser after Chrome. I will say that it is much faster than Internet Explorer.</p>

<h1 class="header">Google Chrome Page</h1>
<p>This is the google chrome page!</p>
<p>Honestly I don't really like the combination of red and green. I understand that they are complimentary 
but I mean... it's kind of ugly in my opinion.</p>
<p>To fill some more of the page, I will introduce some information about Google Chrome. Chrome was initially 
released in 2008 to Windows and later introduced to Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Something else, is that it is 
available in 47 languages.</p>

            <p>Now that you have your ICOCA card, you're going to want to know how to use it. This is very simple!<br /><br />
            To use your card:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>Walk to the gate where your train platform is</li>
              <li>Touch your ICOCA card to the blue-rounded-square on the gate</li>
              <li>The yellow flaps between the gate will open</li>
              <li>walk through the gate and board your train</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
  
            When you go to exit the train at your final station, you will follow the same steps mentioned above to exit the gates and leave the station.

                <h4>3. Osaka</h4>
                <p>Osaka (pronounced 'Ouh-Sah-Kah'), formerly named Naniwa, is one of Japan's most popular prefectures. It is home to a wonderful city, named after the prefecture, called Osaka. So if you're someone who enjoys taking strolls through the metropolitan area, Osaka may be a good stop for you.<br /></p>

                Osaka is home to all sorts of different types of food as well. If you're a foodie, this place is one of the most recognized places in Japan when it comes to your favorite pass-time!<br /><br />Below are a few pictures of different kinds of food or restaurants you can find throughout Japan, but each prefecture is slightly different on how they prepare and present the dish.<br /></p>

                <p>Two other places that are neat to go to while visiting Osaka would be Shinsaibashi-Suji Street and America-Mura.<br /></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>ShinsaiBashi is a shopping district located south of Osaka Station and sees thousands of shoppers each day!<br /></p>

                    <div class="imgBox">
                        <img src="../images/AmericaMura.jpg" alt="America-Mura" style="flex-grow: 1"/>
                        <img src="../images/AmericaMuraMall.jpg" alt="America-Mura Mall" style="flex-grow: 1">
                    </div>
                    <p>America Mura, literally meaning 'America Town' is a portion of town that sells things that can be found in America. It's Osaka's little ode to America. These are two pictures that I took. One of which is of one of the most iconic areas in America Mura.<br />
                    People will come to this place and sit and eat, skateboard, or just come to hang out.</p>

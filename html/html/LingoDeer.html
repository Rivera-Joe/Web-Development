        <h3 class="appName">LingoDeer</h3>
        <p class="appInfo">LingoDeer is an application, focused on learning spoken and written language, that was released on September 8, 2017. LingoDeer features many languages that can be learned by the users of this app. Some examples of the taught languages include:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>English</li>
          <li>Spanish</li>
          <li>Korean</li>
          <li>Mandarin</li>
          <li>German</li>
        </ul>
        LingoDeer uses a different approach to teaching a language than what I would assume most other language learning apps or sites use. LD is set up similar to what you would see in SoloLearn(possibly why I am so biased towards it), in that it uses a fill-in-the-blank approach. The app breaks each language down into smaller sections focusing on topics such as colors, verbs, adjectives, nouns, etc. Each topic is held in a list that users will work their way through to achieve the level of fluency that they desire. After a few sections, there is a quiz based on the past few sections to help reinforce what the user has learned. There is even a story that further teaches a section. This portion is optional, but I would recommend that anyone using the application should participate in the story, as it will often teach extra words or phrases that were not mentioned in the section that the story revolves around.</p>
